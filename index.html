        <li>How many books have you not started, but want to read?</li>
        <li>Some Virtual True Dungeon may be fun.</li>
        <li>Pokemon Go has an event this weekend.</li>
        <li><s>Maybe get some homework done?</s></li>
        <li>Getting caught up on some TV could kill a few hours.</li>
